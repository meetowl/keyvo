# Keyvo


Touch-typing (or not) testing utility that helps you map every key into your 
muscle memory through rigorous pseudo-random tests, or user-programmed
paragraphs. This will not teach you how to touch type, but will rather 
test (and therefore increase) your typing accuracy, and correctness around the 
keyboard. Some tests will not increase speed, as they are purely random words.


Please note that I have mainly written this program to get used to C development
, and should not be taken *that* seriously.
