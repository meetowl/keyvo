* TODO Scroll functionality
  [[./window.c][window.c]]
  - Needs scrollback as well
  - Make sure to make obvious that text goes beyond page
  - I don't think scroll() or scrl() can help us here
* TODO Most commonly mistaken letter
  - Scan the input string to search for the most commonly backspaced /
    incorrectly entered  string
  - Also, see which 
* TODO Allow user settable test string size
  - Perhaps make a preferences screen?
* TODO Bugfixes
  - "Previous selection" 
  - C-x doesn't work on first character
  - Setting large str size segfaults
* TODO Small usability/design tweaks
  - Make p and q menu entries appear at the bottom
* Code cleanup
** TODO Reorganize headers
   - Currently, cyclic dependencies 
     (i.e. b.h:"#include a.h" -> a.h:"#include b.h")
	 are a pretty gosh darn big problem
** TODO Reformat code 
   - Your currently have 300 different styles in this code, stop it.
** TODO create universal character redrawer
   - Your redraw_char() should check whether character is correct by
     itself, rather than the outside telling it whether it's a space
     or not.
   - Could be used in test_string() and scrolltxtdown(), as currently
     boiler plate code is in there
** TODO redo poop code in scrolltxtdown()
   - EWW gross gross gross gross
* TODO make typing string its own window
  - Life would be easier if you had a buffered window just for the
    typing string
  - No more overhead or start_curs_y
* TODO make scrolling better
  - You should do [[make typing string its own window][this]] before you implement this
  - Currently, you're rewriting the entire thing.
  - What if we just "pushed" from one row to another?
  - mvwaddch(y-1, x-1, win, c) and look if you can save the
	attributes of each character (i.e. green or red)
  - Perhaps have a buffer that stores the whole text?
  - Faster? Slower? Think about it.
